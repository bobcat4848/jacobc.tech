# Introduction
jacobc.tech is a personal website made in react using Next.js that showcases all of my current and past projects that I am working on. From the website you can also find my 
email and directly setup a meeting on the contact page. You can also find my resume if needed. 


### Future Plans:
- Add a blog portion
- Add a preloader to allow for images to load
- Continue making visual enhancements as seen fit

### Editing Locally
    npm install
    npm run dev
